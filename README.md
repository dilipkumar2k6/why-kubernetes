- Open sourced by Google in June 2014 and handed over to `CNCF`
- `CNCF` is Cloud Native Computing Foundation which is part of `Linux` foundation
- Its written in `Go` language.
- Code is hosted on https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes
- Borg was first propriety container orchestrator tool developed in house by Google.
- Google Omega was next propriety orchestrator tool developed by Google to fix the shortcoming of Borg.
- Google then developed Kubernetes as an open source orchestrator framework by extending Omega.

- `K8s` is a short form of `Kubernetes` which replace 8 letters after `K` and before `s` in `Kubernetes` word.

# What Kubernetes does?
- Container brings scalability challenges
- Kubernetes helps to manage container
- It allows large numbers of containers to work together in harmony, reducing operational burden.
- It helps running containers across many different machines.
- It helps scaling up or down by adding or removing containers when demand changes.
- It facilitates both declarative configuration and automation.

It needs following two things
- Standard pacakge format
- Manifest 

# What is Kubernetes and Docker?
- Docker is currently the most popular container platform. 
- Kubernetes and Docker are both fundamentally different technologies but they work very well together, and both facilitate the management and deployment of containers in a distributed architecture.

Following are containers orchestrating solutions
1. Kubernetes
2. Docker swarm 
3. Mesos
